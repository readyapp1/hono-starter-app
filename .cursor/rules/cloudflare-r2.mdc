This Hono HTTP API project is deployed to the Cloudflare Workers platform and manages Object storage for file uploads and downloads via Cloudflare R2 infrastructure.

Object storage operation guidelines:
- File uploads from the frontend should be made directly from the frontend Nuxt SPA application to Cloudflare R2 via the mechanism of Pre-signed URLs.
- File downloads and access to users' files from the frontend should be made directly from the frontend Nuxt SPA application via the mechanism of Pre-signed URLs. 
- You shouldn't use the packages `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-signer` because they are incompatible with Workers which defines a browser environment target and then they require DOMParser to be present. So instead, you should use `aws4fetch`.
