## About Hono Web Framework

Learn about the Hono web framework by visiting the following llms.txt file and browsing the Hono documentation pages referneed from it: https://hono.dev/llms.txt

## Local development guidelines

- You should never run the Hono server yourself in your own process like `pnpm dev`. Instead, you should ask me to run it or stop it as required. We choose this way so that our server ports do not conflict.
